  Improper belief : Is a belief that isn't concerned with describing the territory. Note that the fact that a belief just happens to be true doesn't mean you're right to have it. If you buy a lottery ticket, certain that it's a winning ticket (for no reason), and it happens to be, believing that was still a mistake.
  Belief in belief : Where it is difficult to believe a thing, it is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it. Were you to really believe and not just believe in belief, the consequences of error would be much more severe. When someone makes up excuses in advance, it would seem to require that belief, and belief in belief, have become unsynchronized.

  NIH Syndrome : Or Not Invented Here, to avoid using already existing products, research, standards, or knowledge because of their external origins or costs.
  Anti-Pattern : A common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive.
  Worse Is Better : The idea that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.
  Dogfood : A way for an organization to demonstrate confidence in its own products, by using the product itself. A way to test it in real-world usage, acting as quality control and a kind of testimonial advertising.
  Stovepipe : A system that has the potential to share data or functionality with other systems but which does not.
  The Cathedral model : The source code is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of developers.
  The Bazaar model : The source code is developed over the Internet in view of the public.
  XY Problem : You want to do X, and you think Y is the best way of doing so. Instead of asking about X, you ask about Y.
  Second System Effect : The tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems, due to inflated expectations and overconfidence.
  Benevolent Dictator For Life : A open-source software development practice where project founders retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community.
  Yak Shaving : Refers to a task, that leads you to perform another related task and so on, and so on — all distracting you from your original goal.
  
TECHNOCRACY
  Sybil attack : An attacker subverts the reputation system of a P2P network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.
  Siren Servers : Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the server concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data center. Alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses.
  Paradox of tolerance : States that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.
  The Veil Of Ignorance : Behind this veil, you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities, position in society, sex, race, nationality, or individual tastes. All individuals are simply specified as rational, free, and morally equal beings. 
  Behavioral sink : A term used to describe the collapse in behavior(stress, alienation, hostility, sexual perversion, parental incompetence, and rabid violence) which resulted from overcrowdedness in an experiment on mice, drawing parallels with societal collapse found in the human Megalopolis.
  Dunbar's Number : A suggested cognitive limit of 150, to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.

PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING
  Space learning over time :  Spaced schedules of studying and testing produce better long-term retention than a single study session or test.
  Worked example solutions problem solving exercises :  Presenting the students step-by-step solutions to problems should be intermixed with having the students solve the problems by themselves.
  Combine graphics with verbal descriptions :  Materials presented in verbal, visual and multimedia form are richer representations than those with a single modality or medium.
  Abstract and concrete representations of concepts :  An understanding of an abstract concept improves with multiple and varied concrete examples.
  Use quizzing to promote learning : Testing enhances learning, particularly when the tests are aligned with important content.
  Help students allocate study time effectively : Students need to allocate more time on difficult material and to have repeated practice for some concepts and skills. Outlining, integrating and synthesizing information produces better learning than re-reading materials or other more passive strategies.
  Ask deep explanatory questions : Students benefit more from asking and answering deep questions that elicit explanations (e.g., why, why not, how, what if) than shallow questions (e.g., who, what, when, where).
  Contiguity : Ideas that need to be associated should be presented contiguously in space and time.
  Perceptual-motor grounding : Students learn better when teachers link concepts to concrete perceptual motor experiences, particularly at early stages of learning.
  Generation effect : Learning is better when learners actively produce answers, rather than merely recognize answers as in multiple-choice questions.
  Stories and example cases : Learners tend to remember stories and example cases better than didactic facts and abstract principles.
  Feedback : Students benefit from feedback on their performance in a learning task, with the timing depending on the task. Learning incorrect information can be reduced when students are given immediate feedback.
  Manageable cognitive load : Learning materials should not overload working memory.
  Cognitive disequilibrium : Deep reasoning and learning is stimulated by problems that create cognitive disequilibrium, such as obstacles to goals, contradictions, conflict and anomalies.
  Cognitive flexibility : Students’ cognitive flexibility improves when they are presented with multiple viewpoints that link facts, skills, procedures and deep conceptual principles.
  Goldilocks principle : Assignments should not be too hard or too easy, but at the right level of difficulty for each student’s skill and prior knowledge.
  Anchored learning : Learning is deeper and students are more motivated when the materials and skills are anchored in real-world problems that matter to the learner.

CELESTIAL NAVIGATION
  Zenith : The imaginary point directly above a particular location, opposite to the apparent gravitational force at that location.
  Azimuth : The angle offset between the north vector and target's vector on the horizontal plane.
  Longitude : The east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface.
  Latitude : The north-south position of a point on the Earth's surface.
  Nautical Mile : Defined as 1852 meters, or one minute of angle along a meridian on the Earth.
  LAN : Local Apparent Noon.
  NSL : Noon sight latitude.
  GHA : Greenwich hour angle.
  Sun altitude offset : 4 seconds off is equal to 1 nautical mile.

PROGRAMMING PRACTICES
  Prototype before polishing. Get it working before optimizing it.
  Separate policy from mechanism, separate interfaces from engines.
  Write simple modular parts connected by clean interfaces.
  Design programs to be connected to other programs.
  Write programs to write programs when you can.
  Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
  In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
  When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
  When a program must fail, it should fail noisily and as soon as possible.
  Write big programs only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
  Consider how you would solve your immediate problem without adding anything new.

DESIGN KNOWLEDGE
  Good design makes a product useful.
  Good design makes a product understandable.
  Good design is unobtrusive.
  Good design is honest.
  Good design is long-lasting.
  Good design is thorough down to the last detail.
  Good design is environmentally friendly.
  Good design is as little design as possible.

DESIGN PRAGNANZ
  The mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point.
  The mind perceives objects that are near, or proximate to each other, to be grouped together.
  The mind can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory, on average.
  The mind has a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
  The mind remembers uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
  The mind will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible.
  The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
  The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

WORK KNOWLEDGE
  Find your passion and figure out how to get paid for it.
  Do whatever you want to do, but be the best at it.
  Strive for simplicity and competence, but embrace the messiness along the way.
  Under-promise and over-deliver, and own up to your screw-ups.
  Doing what everybody else is doing feels like the safest thing to do, making it the most competitive, and thus the riskiest.
  No one is on their deathbed is wishing they spent more time at work.
  Never stop learning.

WORK HABITS
  Doing the right tasks is more important than doing your tasks efficiently.
  Write down your goals. Break them down into manageable tasks.
  Tackle one task at a time, and group similar tasks together.
  You're more attentive in the morning, tackle hard stuff then.
  If you can't do it in 8 hours, you can't do it in 10.
  Don't forget to stretch, and drink plenty of water.
  Keep a record of your time use.

WORK CHARISMA
  Always look a person in the eye when you talk to them.
  Always stand up to shake someone's hand.
  Be conscious of your body language.
  Ask more than you answer.
  First impressions matter.
  When you walk, look straight ahead, not at your feet.
  Never hit anyone unless they are an immediate threat.
  No matter their job or status, everyone deserves your respect.

WRITING KNOWLEDGE
  Never use a long word where a short one will do.
  If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
  Never use the passive where you can use the active.
  Never use a foreign or scientific word, if you can think of an English equivalent.
  Never use a figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
  Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

DARK MOUNTAINEERS
  We will face this reality honestly and learn how to live with it.
  We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of problems in need of technological or political solutions.
  We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in the stories we have been telling ourselves.
  The end of the world as we know it is not the end of the world full stop.
  Humans are not the point and purpose of the planet.
  The Dark Mountaineers intend to challenge the stories which underpin our civilisation
  The myth of progress, The myth first tells us that we are destined for greatness, that we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called ‘nature', which we have now triumphantly subdued.
  The myth of human centrality, The myth that humans are the point and purpose of the planet.
  The myth of separation from nature, The myth that humans exist outside of natural forces, and that the agent that is nature can be vainquised.

ACTION WISDOM
  Control of actions and speech to avoid unwholesome actions.
  Effort to work as much as possible for the good of others, even at the risk of one's life.
  Decision to devote oneself to beneficial actions and to remain steadfast on it.
  Maintaining a state of mind turned to the happiness of others, to practise love for all beings without exception.
  Development of knowledge and understanding through study and analytical reflection. To teach knowledge to others. To use one's wisdom for a maximum of benefits.
  You may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down your competitors.
  The creatures who act as though they belong to the world follow the peace-keeping law, they give the creatures around them a chance to grow toward watever it's possible for them to become. That's how man came into being, the australopithecus didn't imagine that the world belonged to them, so they let him live and grow.
  You must absolutely and forever relinquish the idea that you know who live and who should die on this planet.
