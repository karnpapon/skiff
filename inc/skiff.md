to inherite [Longtermism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU) philosophy, solutioning for technological resilience and sustainability.
by omitting JavaScript and only using plaintext database called [indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/indental.html)(with slightly modifications) and [tablatal](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/tablatal.html) to generate HTML/CSS.
almost any device is able to intepret and display them hence the website generated by skiff is vary accessible.
this (might) encourage to rethink about technological waste and responsibility for an environment.


## Usage.
- add data content in `/rustlib/database/lexicon.ndtl` (example below).
- add an cover image file in `/media/images/*.(jpg|png)` then add image data in `/rustlib/database/journals.ndtl`.(currently, database path is not configurable) then `cargo run` at rustlib folder.
- skiff will manage to parse > link > build and outputs HTML file where it'll be located at `/site`
- for additional details, create file name identical to entity in `lexicon.ndtl` eg. `skiff.md` the output file will be injected `skiff.md` after parsing `lexicon.ndtl`.
