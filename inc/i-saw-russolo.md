I was asked to join flea market event at [DE COMMUNE](https://www.facebook.com/decommunebkk/), a “come together” project by a passionate group of people from the underground who share similar interests in starting a live house/art space/club with a caring quality for sound-system, lighting and visuals. 

this is the first product came into my mind as a funny project, but i found it's really encouraging to rethink the meaning of fun.
noise pattern was generated by [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).
  the package was silkscreened by hands.
